# **Option Chain with Advanced Analysis**  

![Project Banner](https://dummyimage.com/600x200/000/fff&text=Option+Chain+Analysis)

## **Overview**  
This project is a web application that provides **real-time NSE Option Chain data** with advanced analysis features. The frontend is developed using **React** for a modern, dynamic user interface, while the backend uses **Flask** to handle APIs and data processing.  

With this tool, users can explore **market trends, strike prices, open interest (OI), volume data**, and more in a user-friendly way. Advanced filters allow users to fetch **personalized data** and perform analysis with detailed insights.  

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch the latest NSE Option Chain data.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.  
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Interactive fields for selecting symbols, expiry dates, and timestamps.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Includes OI percentage, volume percentage, and OI change percentage tracking.  
- **Data Logs**: Users can view logs of fetched data.
- **Responsive UI**: Modern and responsive design using React, optimized for both desktop and mobile.  
- **Hacker Theme**: Sleek, dark-themed UI for an engaging user experience.
- **Historical Data**: Save data to a database and query based on date, symbol, and time.

---

## **Technologies Used**
### Frontend:
- **React.js**: Component-based library for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the application with a hacker theme.  

### Backend:
- **Flask**: A Python-based micro-framework to handle API requests and data processing.
- **Pandas**: Used for real-time data fetching and analysis.
- **SQLite/MySQL** (or any other DB): Store historical option chain data.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** and npm  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/option-chain-analysis.git
cd option-chain-analysis
```

### **Backend Setup (Flask)**
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Frontend Setup (React)**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **Usage Instructions**
1. **Login/Register**: Create an account to access personalized features.
2. **Select a Symbol and Expiry**: Use the dropdowns to choose the stock or index and the expiry date.
3. **Analyze Data**: View the OI, volume, and other metrics for each strike price.
4. **Check Logs**: See detailed logs for the fetched data in the Logs section.
5. **Save Historical Data**: Use the “Save” button to store data in the database.
